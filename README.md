# MY SQL EXERCISES


## What are SQL and RDBMS?
**SQL**, *Structured Query Language*, is a computer language that allows you to communicate with databases.

**RDBMS** *Relational Database Management System*, is used to interact with a database. It serves as the interface between a user and a database allowing the user to employ SQL to interact with the database

MySQL is a Relational Database Management System, RDBMS, used to interact with a database. It serves as the interface between a user and a database allowing the user to employ SQL to interact with the database.

## Fundamental RDBMS Terms

A Relational Database Management System is a collection of related tables used to store and manage data. Each table should have a **primary key** serving as its unique identifier.

Flavors --> *MySQL, PostgreSQL Oracle, Access, MS SQL*

A **schema** is like a blueprint for a database showing the relationships between tables and their primary and foregin keys. In MySQL, the term is interchangeable with database.

A **Table** is a collection of records. Each table should have a primary key and may have a foreign key relating it to another table in the database.

A **Record** is a single observation or row in a table.

A **Field** is a single category or column in a table.

A **Value** is the content of a single cell.


## Fundamental SQL Terms
- **Query** is a request that returns information or records. A query can contain multiple clauses, each containing one or more SQL keywords, but it can also be as simple as a SELECT * statement that returns all fields followed by a FROM table_name clause indicating the table you want the data to come from.

- **Statement** is any valid piece of code that is executable by a RDBMS.

- **Clause** is a subsection of a query that contains at least one keyword and the accompanying information, like fields or tables, to be used with the keyword.

- **Keyword** is a reserved word that performs an operation.
